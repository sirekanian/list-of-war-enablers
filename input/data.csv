This connection with the Russian leader helped him maintain his considerable wealth. He is a major shareholder of the steel group Evraz, which is one of Russia’s largest taxpayers. He has therefore been benefitting from Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine. He is also one of the leading Russian businesspersons involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine.
Involved in corruption schemes of PJSC Gazprom and its subsidiaries. Participated in the formation of corrupt sources of income for Vladimir Putin and his closest associates.
Russian oligarch. Amid the war, he remains involved in the system of Russian political corruption, in which capital is an instrument for acquiring political influence, and political influence is a condition for preserving capital, at the highest level.
He is a Russian oligarch with longstanding and close ties to Vladimir Putin dating back to the late 1990s. He was part of the circle that Putin owed his presidency to as the successor to Russia's first president, Boris Yeltsin. Abramovich has enjoyed privileged access to the president and has maintained a strong relationship with him, a connection that has helped him preserve his considerable wealth. He ranked 16th on Forbes' list of """"125 Billionaires of Russia,"""" with a fortune of 9.7 billion USD. He is a major shareholder of the steel group Evraz, directly owning 28.64% of the shares. Evraz is one of Russia’s largest taxpayers and supplies raw materials to Uralvagonzavod, a producer of tanks and civilian products, as well as other companies in the defense industry.

In addition to Evraz, Abramovich also owns shares in other major Russian companies such as Norilsk Nickel, Yandex, and Renaissance Insurance. His business ventures have benefitted from Russian decision-makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of Ukraine. He is one of the leading Russian business figures involved in economic sectors that provide substantial revenue to the Russian government, which is responsible for these actions. Despite the ongoing war, Abramovich remains entangled in Russia’s system of political corruption, where capital serves as a tool for acquiring political influence, and political influence is essential for preserving capital at the highest levels.

Roman Abramovich is also involved in corruption schemes related to Gazprom PJSC and its subsidiaries, playing a role in generating corrupt income for Vladimir Putin and his closest associates.","Individuals involved in corruption

As a State Duma deputy from the ruling United Russia party, Kabaeva successively followed the party’s fluctuations: the last bill she signed was about labeling NGOs critical of the Kremlin policies as “foreign agents”. This law, adopted in response to the growth of protest activity since 2011, marked a government attack on independent civil society structures, aiming at their discredit and creating legal prerequisites for their prosecution. Kabaeva voted for a few of these controversial laws that were speedily adopted in 2012 and 2013. Also, Alina Kabaeva participated in the creation of the so-called “Dima Yakovlev Law”, popularly called the “law of scoundrels”, which, among other things, forbade Americans to adopt Russian children, including those terminally ill.

He is the leading public supporter of Vladimir Putin and his policies among oligarchs and representatives of big business. He has benefited significantly from the withdrawal of Western companies from the Russian market, acquiring their assets at non-market prices. In April 2022, Vladimir Potanin's Interros acquired Rosbank from the French group Société générale and a stake from the founder of Tinkoff Bank (currently known as T-Bank), which the latter was forced to sell due to his anti-war stance.

He has been a sponsor of the United Russia party since its foundation. This party supports Russia's aggression against Ukraine and serves as Vladimir Putin's main support in his established political system.","Individuals involved in corruption
